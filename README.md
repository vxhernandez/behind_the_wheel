Car Dealership Database Project

---
This repository serves as a showcase of my experience in database management, analysis techniques and demonstrates my end-to-end skills in handling the database development lifecycle. 

### Key Features:

- **Database Design:** Designed a robust database schema and created tables to efficiently store data.
- **Data Population:** Populated the database with relevant data and ensured data integrity.
- **Data Cleansing and ETL:** Conducted data cleaning and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to prepare the data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzed the data to identify patterns, trends, and insights that drive decision-making.
- **Analytical Questions:** Defined and answered pertinent analytical questions to uncover actionable insights.
- **Tools and Technologies:**
    - Notion.io for requirements analysis
    - Lucidchart for designing the ERD and ETL Diagrams
    - SSIS/Visual Studios for the ETL processes
    - SQL Server for database creation
    - Excel for data cleansing
    - Tableau for developing dashboard

### Goals:

Follow the sequential steps outlined in the roadmap to enhance my proficiency as an SQL Developer.

### Roadmap for the project:

By following this roadmap, I was able to systematically progress through each stage of the project, ensuring thorough analysis and effective presentation of insights derived from the car dealership database.

1. **Choose a Topic and Define Objectives**
    - This database project focuses on car dealership sales with the objective to design and implement an efficient database system tailored to Value Voyage Autoâ€™s needs. Through this project, I aim to deliver a valuable asset empowering the car dealership to enhance sales strategies, customer satisfaction, and overall business performance.

2. **Identify Analytical Questions**
    - In selecting 25 analytical questions for the car dealership database project, I aim to delve into various aspects of sales, customer behavior, and employee performance. By addressing these analytical questions through data analysis and interpretation, I aim to gain valuable insights that can inform strategic decision-making, enhance operational efficiency, and drive business growth.

3. **Design Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**
    - The creation of a Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) is crucial for visualizing the relationships between entities within the car dealership database. The ERD serves as a blueprint that illustrates the structure of the database, including the various entities, their attributes, and the relationships between them.
    
    In designing the ERD for the car dealership database, I identify the primary entities involved, such as "Cars," "Customers," "Sales," "Salespeople," "Dealerships". Relationships between entities are depicted by lines connecting them, with cardinality indicators to specify the nature of the relationship (one-to-one, one-to-many, or many-to-many).
    
    For example, the "Cars" entity has attributes such as "car_id," "make," "model," "year," "price," and "color." And has relationships with other entities such as "Sales" (indicating the sale of a specific car) and "Dealerships" (denoting the dealership that sells the car).
    
    The "Customers" includes attributes "customer_ID," "first_name," "last_name," "email," and "primary_phone," and will be linked to the "Sales" entity to record customer purchases. The "Salespeople" entity will contain attributes such as "sales_person_id," "first_name," "last_ame," and is associated with the "Sales" entity to track sales made by each salesperson.
    
    The ERD, ensures all relevant entities and their relationships are accurately represented, providing a clear and comprehensive overview of the database structure.

4. **Database Design (DDL)**
    - Define the database schema and create the necessary tables using Data Definition Language (DDL).

5. **Normalization and Optimization**
    - Check for normalization issues and optimize the database structure for efficiency.

6. **Database Implementation**
    - Execute the database creation process based on the finalized DDL.

7. **Design Data Pipeline Diagram**
    - Visualize the data flow and pipeline architecture for ETL and ELT processes.

8. **Data Acquisition for ETL/ELT**
    - Gather suitable datasets for Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) processes and or Extract Load Transform (ELT)
        - **Extract:**
            - Utilize flat files, aggregated tables, manual data entry, or existing datasets.
        - **Transform/Cleansing:**
            - Apply normalization techniques and conduct data cleansing to ensure data quality.

9. **Perform SQL Analysis**
    - Answer the analytical questions using SQL programming techniques.

10. **Advanced SQL Programming**
    - Implement advanced SQL programming concepts to enhance data analysis and manipulation.

11. **Create Tableau Visualizations**
    - Develop interactive and informative visualizations in Tableau to present the analyzed data.

12. **GitHub Project Portfolio**
    - Add the completed project, including documentation, code, and visualizations, to my GitHub portfolio for showcase and sharing.

13. **Lessons Learned**
    - What insights have you gained from your involvement in this project?
    - How would you approach this project differently in hindsight?
    - Pinpoint areas in need of enhancement or refinement.

14. **Next Steps**
    - Gather feedback from colleagues and experts in the field to pinpoint avenues for improvement.
    - Enumerate additional tasks or features that could enrich the SQL experience within the project.
