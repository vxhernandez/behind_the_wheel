Car Dealership Database Project

---
This repository serves as a showcase of my expertise in database management and analysis techniques and demonstrates my end-to-end skills in handling the database development lifecycle. From requirements analysis and planning, designing an ERD, executing end-to-end ETL processes, database creation using SQL Server to developing visually intuitive dashboards. 

### Key Features:

- **Database Design:** Designed a robust database schema and created tables to efficiently store data.
- **Data Population:** Populated the database with relevant data and ensured data integrity.
- **Data Cleaning and ETL:** Conducted data cleaning and ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to prepare the data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzed the data to identify patterns, trends, and insights that drive decision-making.
- **Analytical Questions:** Defined and answered pertinent analytical questions to uncover actionable insights.
- **Tools and Technologies:** Utilized various tools and technologies, including Notion.io for requirements analysis, Lucidchart for designing Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERD), SSIS for ETL processes, SQL Server for database creation, Excel for data cleansing, and Tableau for developing a visually intuitive dashboard.

### Roadmap for the car dealership database project:

1. **Choose a Topic and Define Objectives**
    - Select a relevant topic for the database project and clearly define the objectives and goals.

2. **Identify Analytical Questions**
    - Formulate 5 to 10 insightful questions about the chosen data that you aim to answer through analysis.

3. **Design Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**
    - Create a clear and comprehensive ERD to visualize the relationships between entities in the database.

4. **Database Design (DDL)**
    - Define the database schema and create the necessary tables using Data Definition Language (DDL).

5. **Normalization and Optimization**
    - Check for normalization issues and optimize the database structure for efficiency.

6. **Database Implementation**
    - Execute the database creation process based on the finalized DDL.

7. **Design Data Pipeline Diagram**
    - Visualize the data flow and pipeline architecture for ETL and ELT processes.

8. **Data Acquisition for ETL**
    - Gather suitable datasets for Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) processes.
        - **Extract:**
            - Utilize flat files, aggregated tables, manual data entry, or existing datasets.
        - **Transform/Cleansing:**
            - Apply normalization techniques and conduct data cleansing to ensure data quality.

9. **Perform SQL Analysis**
    - Answer the analytical questions using SQL programming techniques.

10. **Advanced SQL Programming**
    - Implement advanced SQL programming concepts to enhance data analysis and manipulation.

11. **Create Tableau Visualizations**
    - Develop interactive and informative visualizations in Tableau to present the analyzed data.

12. **GitHub Project Portfolio**
    - Add the completed project, including documentation, code, and visualizations, to my GitHub portfolio for showcase and sharing.

By following this roadmap, I can systematically progress through each stage of the project, ensuring thorough analysis and effective presentation of insights derived from the car dealership database.
